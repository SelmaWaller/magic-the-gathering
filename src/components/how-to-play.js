<p>
    In the Magic game, you play the role of a planeswalkerâ€”a powerful
    wizard who fights other planeswalkers for glory, knowledge, and
    conquest. Your deck of cards represents all the weapons in your
    arsenal. It contains the spells you know and the creatures you can
    summon to fight for you.
</p>
<p>
    Trading card games like the Magic: The Gathering TCG combine
    collectable cards with a strategy game. You don't know what you'll
    get in a Magic booster pack. You just start a collection and trade
    with other players to get the cards you want.
</p>
<p>
    The best part about a trading card game is that it's always
    changing. You design and build your own unique decks, and each
    Magic game you play is different. New Magic expansions are
    released a few times a year, and each new expansion brings new
    ways to stupefy and defeat your opponents.
