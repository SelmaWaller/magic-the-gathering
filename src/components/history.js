<h2>The history of Magic</h2>
<p>
    As it turns out, the game almost didn’t happen. In 1991, Wizards
    of the Coast was busy printing roleplaying games and supplements,
    and operated out of Peter Adkison’s basement. Adkison was the
    owner and CEO of Wizards when he was approached by Dr. Richard
    Garfield, a doctoral candidate in combinatorial mathematics.
    Garfield was interested in having Wizards publish his “RoboRally”
    board game design.

<p>
    Adkison liked RoboRally (and would later produce it through
    Wizards) but he felt at the time that Wizards didn’t possess the
    resources or technical know-how to produce a board game. He asked
    Garfield to instead come up with a simple game that could be
    played in minutes, and that was portable enough that people could
    play it while “waiting in line at conventions.”

<p>
    Garfield went back to his workshop and emerged with the very first
    version of the game we now know as Magic.
